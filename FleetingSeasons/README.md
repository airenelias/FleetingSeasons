## Descrpition
Shrink seasons from 28 days to 14 and compact all the holidays into two eventful weeks.  
## Configuraton
Season length can be changed in BepInEx configuraton:  
`...\Old Market Simulator\BepInEx\config\AirenElias.FleetingSeasons.cfg`  
It's set to 0.5 by default, so seasons will be half the length. You can enter any value less than 1 to adjust it (for example, 0.75 for 21 days per season or 0.25 for a season of only one week).
